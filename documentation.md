# The purpose of your application I need a system for my orienteering club to manage register for events and transport to events. Events have 3 types (race, training, training camp) and I want to track that however registering and transport works the same. 

First I need to create an event and add a type. Next my club members will register themselves to the event and tell if they need to help with transport or not. Trainer will then close the register for the event and see all registered members and their transport preference for this event and manually figure out what to do with it.

Each member has profile with his information and also can see all the events he can register to and also can see all the events he participated in.
